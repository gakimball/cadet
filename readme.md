I'm trying to a multiplayer spaceship-piloting thing with Meteor (to handle client/server interaction) and Box2DWeb (to handle physics). If it's not finished by January 4 than *it may never be finished*.

**Process:**

- [x] Meteor set up
- [x] Box2DWeb set up
- [x] Map with walls generated
- [x] Ship that can move in four directions
- [x] Physics sim running on Meteor server
- [x] Input are passed from client to server
- [x] Objects are passed from server to client and drawn
- [x] Ship can shoot in four directions
- [x] Ship takes damage from collision
- [ ] Enemies that shoot
- [ ] Engineering console
- [ ] Multiple weapon types
